"Shapefile-read"


Python code to read and display a Shapefile according to the Esri standard in binary mode.
No ready-made libraries or modules for working with Shapefiles have been used at all. Only unrelated libraries such as tkinter (for file access and GUI), struct (for working with binary files), or matplotlib, numpy, etc., was used.
